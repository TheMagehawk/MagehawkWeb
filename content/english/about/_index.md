Hey, my name is Magehawk, but people also like to just call me Mage. I am a Computer Scientist and Developer currently studying in Germany. I love to spend my time playing Games with my friends, workout in my freetime, develop and write code and make my Projects grow bigger and bigger. My current focus is working on my very own general-purpose Engine called "Crescent Engine".

Crescent is a general-purpose Engine made with flexibility, configurability, efficiency and portability in mind. Originally I, Magehawk, wanted to just work on a more ambitious Programming Project to work on my skillsets and gain experience and proficiency. It turned out to become a huge part of my development process and now I strive to create a community around my projects and share my thoughts on it. Hopefully, I can help other people with their programming journey or help them develop cool Games :)

Check out my Website for Crescent Engine:

Anyway, enjoy your time around here. Also check out my ChicknFish Discord to learn more about me and my Engine :D
