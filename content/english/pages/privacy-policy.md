### Scope of This Notice

This Privacy Statement is intended to describe Magehawk's privacy practices and provide information about the choices you have regarding the ways in which information collected by Magehawk is used and disclosed.

It covers both online platforms of the Crescent project and the use of applications made by Magehawk.

#### Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to Magehawk. To better protect your privacy and to comply with various laws and regulations, we have provided this Statement explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected, used and disclosed. To make this Statement easy to find, we have made it available on our homepage and at many of the locations where personally-identifiable information may be requested.

#### The Information We Collect

This Privacy Statement applies to all information collected by or submitted to Magehawk, including personal data. "Personal data" is data that can be used to identify an individual.

##### Magehawk collects personal data when:

- You visit the Magehawk web site (<a href="/">magehawk.net</a>);

- You submit questions or comments to us.

#### Using (Processing) Your Personal Data

Magehawk uses the personal data you provide to:

- identify and authenticate you
- answer your questions
- send you information
- for research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is not used to contact the subjects of the report)
- send you surveys

We also use this personal data to provide you with information related to your account and the educational materials, software and services you acquire from us, to better understand your needs and interests, to improve what we do for you and the public, to personalize communications, and to comply with or fulfill any contractual obligations to you. It is in Magehawk’s legitimate business interests to provide you with the information, communications, and services you request; to create a public record of the data and content produced by Magehawk’s services; and to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes.

#### Sharing Your Personal Data

Unless you consent, Magehawk will never process or share the personal data you provide to us except as described below.

Magehawk may share your personal data with third parties under any of the following circumstances:

- To attribute your contributions to source repositories
- As required to provide service, and for e-mail housing (as a consequence of uses already described in this Privacy Statement). It is in Magehawk’s legitimate business interest to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided by Magehawk’s services, and to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes. This data and content may include but is not limited to email, code changes, comments, and artifacts.
- As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud).
- For research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is used to describe our services and is not used to contact the subjects of the report).

#### Cookies and Other Browser Information

Magehawk's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our services.

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Magehawk uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of magehawk.net where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "sign in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).

#### Our Commitment to Data Security

Magehawk trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our partners. Our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you send your personal information on our website. In addition, Magehawk and its partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal data.

#### Public Forums Reminder

Magehawk often makes source repositories, issue trackers and forums available to the public. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Please think carefully about your desired level of anonymity before you disclose personal information. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Magehawk reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in Magehawk’s legitimate business interests to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation of software freedom.

#### Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy

Out of special concern for children's privacy, Magehawk does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. Magehawk does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites. Magehawk does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.

In the event that Magehawk ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, Magehawk will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.

Additionally, EU residents under the age of 16 should not submit their personal data for subscribing to our email solicitations and we will delete any such data if we become aware of it.

#### About Links to Other Sites

This site contains links to other sites. Magehawk does not control the information collection of sites that can be reached through links from magehawk.net. If you have questions about the data collection procedures of linked sites, please contact those sites directly.

#### Your Rights and Choices in the EEA and Around the World

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of your personal data, especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against Magehawk:

- The right to access your personal data;
- The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;
- The right to erase your personal data;
- The right to restrict our use of your personal data;
- The right to object to our use of your personal data;
- The right to receive your personal data in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and
- The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@chicknfish.tech">privacy@chicknfish.tech</a>. Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases.

Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to Magehawk, you may do so by mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@chicknfish.tech">privacy@chicknfish.tech</a>. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Magehawk will undertake best efforts to provide these rights to people outside of the EEA as well.

#### How to Access, Modify or Update Your Information

Magehawk gives you the ability to access, modify or update your personal data at any time. On sites where you can create accounts (for example the Forum, Asset Library and Chat platform), you may log in and make changes to your login information (change your password), your contact information, your general preferences and your personalization settings. If necessary, you may also contact us and describe the changes you want made to the personal data you have previously provided by mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@chicknfish.tech">privacy@chicknfish.tech</a>.

If you wish to remove your personal data from Magehawk, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@chicknfish.tech">privacy@chicknfish.tech</a> and request that we remove this information from the Magehawk System. Other locations where you may have used your personal data as an identifier (e.g. forum postings, repository changelogs, etc.) will not be altered.
